This repository contains a Java code example that exhibits unexpected behavior when combining `break` and `continue` statements in a `while` loop. The `Bug.java` file shows the erroneous code, while `BugSolution.java` demonstrates the correction.  The issue arises from the interaction of the increment operation (`i++`) with the conditional checks and the `continue` statement. Carefully examine the code and its corrected version to understand the subtle error and its resolution.
